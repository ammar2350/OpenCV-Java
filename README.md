# Basic OpenCV with Java

Welcome to the **Basic OpenCV with Java** project! This repository is dedicated to beginners and intermediate Java developers looking to integrate basic computer vision functionalities into their applications using OpenCV.

## Project Overview

The **Basic OpenCV with Java** project is designed to introduce Java developers to the core functionalities of OpenCV. It's aimed at those new to computer vision as well as those who wish to understand how to implement these features in Java applications.

The code in this repository covers basic OpenCV operations such as:
- Reading and writing images
- Accessing and modifying pixels
- Handling files and images
- Basic image processing techniques (e.g., grayscale, blur, thresholding)
- Edge detection
- Shape detection
